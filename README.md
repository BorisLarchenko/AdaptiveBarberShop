# AdaptiveBarberShop
In this project I'm using gulp to automate processes

What to do to check this project

1. Clone or download project or fork and clone
2. Go to the project folder and run command `npm i` in order to install all node dependancies for building project.
3. run command: `npm run start` in order to deploy your production version of project in build folder and run local web server to test your page. 

You should see index.html on local server automatically on localhost:3000

One more thing. You can work in source folder and all changes should go to build automatically.
